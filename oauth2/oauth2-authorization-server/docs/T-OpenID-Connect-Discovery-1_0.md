### Abstract

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
 protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based
 on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to
 obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and
 REST-like manner.

This specification defines a mechanism for an OpenID Connect Relying Party
 to discover the End-User's OpenID Provider
 and obtain information needed to interact with it,
 including its OAuth 2.0 endpoint locations.

### 1. Introduction

OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749](#RFC6749) protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based
 on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to
 obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and
 REST-like manner.

In order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party to utilize OpenID Connect services for
 an End-User, the RP needs to know where the OpenID Provider is.
 OpenID Connect uses [RFC7033](#RFC7033) to locate
 the OpenID Provider for an End-User.
 This process is described in [Section 2 (OpenID Provider Issuer Discovery)](#IssuerDiscovery).

Once the OpenID Provider has been identified,
 the configuration information for that OP
 is retrieved from a well-known location as a JSON [RFC7159](#RFC7159) document,
 including its OAuth 2.0 endpoint locations.
 This process is described in [Section 4 (Obtaining OpenID Provider Configuration Information)](#ProviderConfig).

The previous versions of this specification are:

- [OpenID.Discovery.Errata1](#OpenID.Discovery.Errata1)
- [OpenID.Discovery.Final](#OpenID.Discovery.Final)

### 1.2. Terminology

This specification uses the terms "Access Token", "Authorization Code",
 "Authorization Endpoint", "Authorization Grant", "Authorization Server",
 "Client", "Client Authentication", "Client Identifier", "Client Secret",
 "Grant Type", "Protected Resource", "Redirection URI", "Refresh Token",
 "Resource Owner", "Resource Server", "Response Type", and "Token Endpoint"
 defined by [RFC6749](#RFC6749),
 the terms "Claim Name", "Claim Value", and "JSON Web Token (JWT)"
 defined by [JWT](#JWT),
 and the terms defined by [OpenID.Core](#OpenID.Core) and [OAuth.Responses](#OAuth.Responses).

This specification also defines the following terms:
> **Resource**
> Entity that is the target of a request in WebFinger.
>
> **Host**
> Server where a WebFinger service is hosted.
>
> **Identifier**
> Value that uniquely characterizes an Entity in a specific context.
>
> NOTE: this document defines various kinds of Identifiers, designed for use in different contexts.
> Examples include URLs using the https scheme and e-mail addresses.

IMPORTANT NOTE TO READERS: The terminology definitions in
 this section are a normative portion of this specification,
 imposing requirements upon implementations. All the
 capitalized words in the text of this specification, such as
 "Identifier", reference these defined terms.
 Whenever the reader encounters them, their definitions
 found in this section must be followed.

### 2. OpenID Provider Issuer Discovery

OpenID Provider Issuer discovery is the process of determining
 the location of the OpenID Provider.

Issuer discovery is OPTIONAL; if a Relying Party knows the
 OP's Issuer location through an out-of-band mechanism, it can skip this step
 and proceed to [Section 4 (Obtaining OpenID Provider Configuration Information)](#ProviderConfig).

Issuer discovery requires the following information to make a
 discovery request:
> **resource**
> Identifier for the target End-User that is the
> subject of the discovery request.
>
> **host**
> Server where a WebFinger service is hosted.
>
> **rel**
> URI identifying the type of service whose location is being requested.

OpenID Connect uses the following discoverable rel value in [RFC7033](#RFC7033):

| Rel Type              | URI                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| OpenID Connect Issuer | https://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer |

To start discovery of OpenID endpoints, the End-User supplies an
 Identifier to the Relying Party.
 Any Web input form MUST employ Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) prevention [OWASP.CSRF](#OWASP.CSRF).

The RP applies
 normalization rules to the Identifier to determine the Resource and Host.
 Then it makes an HTTP GET request to the Host's [RFC7033](#RFC7033)
 endpoint with the resource and rel parameters to obtain the location of the
 requested service.
 All WebFinger communication MUST utilize TLS
 in the manner described in [Section 7.1 (TLS Requirements)](#TLSRequirements).
 The WebFinger endpoint SHOULD support the use of [CORS](#CORS)
 and/or other methods as appropriate
 to enable Java Script Clients to access it.

The Issuer location MUST be returned in the WebFinger response
 as the value of the href member of
 a links array element
 with rel member value https://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer.
 (Per Section 7 of [RFC7033](#RFC7033), obtaining the
 WebFinger response may first involve following some redirects.)

The returned Issuer location MUST be a URI [RFC3986](#RFC3986)
 with a scheme component that MUST be https,
 a host component, and optionally, port and path components
 and no query or fragment components.
 Note that since the Host and Resource values determined from
 the user input Identifier,
 as described in [Section 2.1 (Identifier Normalization)](#IdentifierNormalization),
 are used as input to a WebFinger request,
 which can return an Issuer value using a completely different
 scheme, host, port, and path, no relationship can be assumed between
 the user input Identifier string and the resulting Issuer location.

---


### 2.1. Identifier Normalization

The purpose of Identifier normalization is to determine normalized
 Resource and Host values from the user input Identifier.
 These are then used as WebFinger request parameters
 to discover the Issuer location.

The user input Identifier SHOULD be a URL or URI relative reference
 defined in [RFC3986](#RFC3986).
 The user input Identifier MUST
 include the authority component.

NOTE: A URI relative reference includes a string that looks like
 an e-mail address in the form of userinfo@host.
 This is a valid authority component of a URI
 but excludes various possible extra strings allowed in addr-spec syntax of [RFC5322](#RFC5322).

The Identifier normalization rules MAY be extended by
 additional specifications to enable other identifier types
 such as telephone numbers or [XRI_Syntax_2.0](#XRI_Syntax_2.0) to also be used.

---


### 2.1.1. User Input Identifier Types

A user input Identifier can be categorized into the following
 types, which require different normalization processes:

1. User input Identifiers starting with the [XRI_Syntax_2.0](#XRI_Syntax_2.0) global context
 symbols ('=','@', and '!') are RESERVED. Processing of
 these identifiers is out of scope for this
 specification.
2. All other user input Identifiers MUST be treated as
 a URI in one of the forms scheme "://" authority path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ] or authority path-abempty [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ] or scheme ":" path-rootless,
 per [RFC3986](#RFC3986).

NOTE: The user input Identifier MAY be in the form
 of userinfo@host.
 For the End-User, this would normally be perceived as being an e-mail address.
 However, it is also
 a valid userpart "@" host section of an acct URI [RFC7565](#RFC7565),
 and this specification
 treats it such as to exclude various
 extra strings allowed in addr-spec of [RFC5322](#RFC5322).

---


### 2.1.2. Normalization Steps

A string of any other type is interpreted as
 a URI in one of the forms scheme "://" authority path-abempty [RFC3986](#RFC3986)
 and is normalized according to the following rules:

1. If the user input Identifier does not have an [RFC3986](#RFC3986) scheme component,
 the string is interpreted as [RFC3986](#RFC3986).
 Examples are example.com, joe@example.com, example.com/joe, and example.com:8080.
2. If the userinfo and host components are present and all of the
 scheme, path, query, port, and fragment components are absent,
 the acct scheme is assumed.
 In this case, the normalized URI is formed by
 prefixing acct: to the string as the scheme.
 Per [RFC7565](#RFC7565),
 if there is an at-sign character ('@') in the userinfo component, it needs to be
 percent-encoded, as described in [RFC3986](#RFC3986).
 Examples are joe@example.com and Jane.Doe@example.com.
3. For all other inputs without a scheme component,
 the https scheme is assumed,
 and the normalized URI is formed by
 prefixing https:// to the string as the scheme.
 Examples are example.com, example.com/joe, example.com:8080, and joe@example.com:8080.
4. When the input contains an explicit scheme such as acct or https that matches the RFC 3986 scheme ":" path-rootless syntax,
 no input normalization is performed.
 Examples are https://example.com, https://example.com/joe, https://joe@example.com:8080, and acct:joe@example.com.
5. If the resulting URI contains a fragment component, it MUST be
 stripped off, together with the fragment delimiter
 character "#".

The [RFC7033](#RFC7033) Resource
 in this case is the resulting URI, and
 the WebFinger Host is the authority component.

NOTE: Since the definition of authority in [RFC3986](#RFC3986)
 is [ userinfo "@" ] host [ ":" port ],
 it is legal to have a user input identifier like userinfo@host:port, e.g., alice@example.com:8080.

### 2.2. Non-Normative Examples

---


### 2.2.1. User Input using E-Mail Address Syntax

To find the Issuer for the given user input
 in the form of an e-mail address joe@example.com,
 the WebFinger parameters are as follows:

| WebFinger Parameter | Value                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| resource            | acct:joe@example.com                       |
| host                | example.com                                |
| rel                 | https://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer |

Note that in this case, the acct: scheme [RFC7565](#RFC7565) is prepended to the Identifier.

The RP would make the
 following WebFinger request to discover the Issuer location
 (with line wraps within lines for display purposes only):

```
GET /.well-known/webfinger
  ?resource=acct%3Ajoe%40example.com
    &rel=https%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer
  HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/jrd+json

{
 "subject": "acct:joe@example.com",
 "links":
  [
   {
    "rel": "https://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer",
    "href": "https://server.example.com"
   }
  ]
}
```

---


### 2.2.2. User Input using URL Syntax

To find the Issuer for the given URL, https://example.com/joe, the WebFinger
 parameters are as follows:

| WebFinger Parameter | Value                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| resource            | https://example.com/joe                    |
| host                | example.com                                |
| rel                 | https://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer |

The RP would make the
 following WebFinger request to discover the Issuer location
 (with line wraps within lines for display purposes only):

```
GET /.well-known/webfinger
  ?resource=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fjoe
    &rel=https%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer
  HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/jrd+json

{
 "subject": "https://example.com/joe",
 "links":
  [
   {
    "rel": "https://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer",
    "href": "https://server.example.com"
   }
  ]
}
```

---


### 2.2.3. User Input using Hostname and Port Syntax

If the user input is in the form of host:port, e.g., example.com:8080,
 then it is assumed as the authority component of the URL.

To find the Issuer for the given
 hostname, example.com:8080, the WebFinger
 parameters are as follows:

| WebFinger Parameter | Value                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| resource            | https://example.com:8080/                  |
| host                | example.com:8080                           |
| rel                 | https://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer |

The RP would make the
 following WebFinger request to discover the Issuer location
 (with line wraps within lines for display purposes only):

```
GET /.well-known/webfinger
  ?resource=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%3A8080%2F
  &rel=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer
  HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com:8080

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/jrd+json

{
 "subject": "https://example.com:8080/",
 "links":
  [
   {
    "rel": "https://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer",
    "href": "https://server.example.com"
   }
  ]
}
```

---


### 2.2.4. User Input using "acct" URI Syntax

To find the Issuer for the given user input
 in the form of an account URI acct:juliet%40capulet.example@shopping.example.com,
 the WebFinger parameters are as follows:

| WebFinger Parameter | Value                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| resource            | acct:juliet%40capulet.example@shopping.example.com |
| host                | shopping.example.com                               |
| rel                 | https://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer         |

The RP would make the
 following WebFinger request to discover the Issuer location
 (with line wraps within lines for display purposes only):

```
GET /.well-known/webfinger
  ?resource=acct%3Ajuliet%2540capulet.example%40shopping.example.com
  &rel=http%3A%2F%2Fopenid.net%2Fspecs%2Fconnect%2F1.0%2Fissuer
  HTTP/1.1
Host: shopping.example.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/jrd+json

{
 "subject": "acct:juliet%40capulet.example@shopping.example.com",
 "links":
  [
   {
    "rel": "https://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer",
    "href": "https://server.example.com"
   }
  ]
}
```

NOTE: It is common for sites to use e-mail addresses as local identifiers
 for accounts at those sites, even though the domain in the e-mail address
 one controlled by the site.
 For instance, the site example.org might have a local account named joe@example.com.
 As of the time of this writing, a discussion is ongoing among WebFinger
 contributors about the syntax that should be used when discovering
 information about such accounts with WebFinger.
 The current thinking seems to be that such accounts would be represented
 by quoting the '@' character in the userinfo component of the account
 identifier when constructing the acct: URI
 representing the account.
 Such an example is acct:joe%40example.com@example.org.
 In a future version of this specification, it is possible that
 normalization rules will be defined allowing End-Users to input
 values like joe@example.com@example.org to initiate discovery on such accounts.

### 3. OpenID Provider Metadata

OpenID Providers have metadata describing their configuration.
 These OpenID Provider Metadata values are used by OpenID Connect:
> **issuer**
> REQUIRED.
> URL using the https scheme with no query or fragment component that the OP asserts as its
> Issuer Identifier.
> If Issuer discovery is supported (see [Section 2 (OpenID Provider Issuer Discovery)](#IssuerDiscovery)),

> This also MUST be identical to the iss Claim value
> in ID Tokens issued from this Issuer.
>
> **authorization_endpoint**
> REQUIRED.
> URL of the OP's OAuth 2.0 Authorization Endpoint [OpenID.Core](#OpenID.Core).

The
 Token Endpoint,
 UserInfo Endpoint, jwks_uri endpoint,
 Dynamic Client Registration Endpoint,
 and any other endpoints directly accessed by Clients
 SHOULD support the use of [CORS](#CORS)
 and/or other methods as appropriate
 to enable Java Script Clients to access them.
 The use of CORS at the Authorization Endpoint is NOT RECOMMENDED
 as it is redirected to by the client and not directly accessed.

Additional OpenID Provider Metadata parameters MAY also be used.
 Some are defined by other specifications,
 such as [OpenID.Session](#OpenID.Session).

### 4. Obtaining OpenID Provider Configuration Information

Using the Issuer location discovered
 as described in [Section 2 (OpenID Provider Issuer Discovery)](#IssuerDiscovery) or by other means,
 the OpenID Provider's configuration information can be retrieved.

OpenID Providers supporting Discovery
 MUST make a JSON document available at the path formed by
 concatenating the string /.well-known/openid-configuration to the
 Issuer.
 The syntax and semantics of .well-known are defined in [RFC5785](#RFC5785) and apply to the Issuer value
 when it contains no path component. openid-configuration MUST point to a JSON document compliant with this specification and
 MUST be returned using the application/json content type.
 The openid-configuration endpoint SHOULD support the use of [CORS](#CORS)
 and/or other methods as appropriate
 to enable Java Script Clients to access it.

---


### 4.1. OpenID Provider Configuration Request

An OpenID Provider's configuration information MUST be retrieved using an HTTP GET request at the previously specified path.

The RP would make the following request to the
 Issuer https://example.com to obtain its Configuration information,
 since the Issuer contains no path component:

```
GET /.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

If the
 Issuer value contains a path component, any terminating / MUST be removed before appending /.well-known/openid-configuration.
 The RP would make the following request to the
 Issuer https://example.com/issuer1 to obtain its configuration information,
 since the Issuer contains a path component:

```
GET /issuer1/.well-known/openid-configuration HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

Using path components enables supporting multiple issuers per host.
 This is required in some multi-tenant hosting configurations.
 This use of .well-known is for supporting
 multiple issuers per host; unlike its use in [RFC5785](#RFC5785), it does not provide
 general information about the host.

---


### 4.2. OpenID Provider Configuration Response

The response is a set of Claims about the OpenID Provider's
 configuration, including all necessary endpoints and
 public key location information.
 A successful response MUST use the 200 OK HTTP status code and return
 a JSON object using the application/json content type
 that contains a set of Claims as its members
 that are a subset of the Metadata values defined in [Section 3 (OpenID Provider Metadata)](#ProviderMetadata).
 Other Claims MAY also be returned.

Claims that return multiple values are represented as JSON arrays.
 Claims with zero elements MUST be omitted from the response.

An error response uses the applicable HTTP status code value.

The following is a non-normative example response:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

 "issuer":
   "https://server.example.com",

}
```

---


### 4.3. OpenID Provider Configuration Validation

If any of the validation procedures defined in this specification fail, any operations requiring
 the information that failed to correctly validate MUST be aborted and
 the information that failed to validate MUST NOT be used.

The issuer value returned MUST be identical to
 the Issuer URL that was directly used to retrieve the configuration information.
 This MUST also be identical to the iss Claim value
 in ID Tokens issued from this Issuer.

---


### 5. String Operations

Processing some OpenID Connect messages requires comparing
 values in the messages to known values. For example, the
 member names in the provider configuration response might be
 compared to specific member names such as issuer. Comparing Unicode [UNICODE](#UNICODE) strings,
 however, has significant security implications.

Therefore, comparisons between JSON strings and other Unicode
 strings MUST be performed as specified below:

1. Remove any JSON applied escaping to produce an array of
 Unicode code points.
2. Unicode Normalization [USA15](#USA15) MUST NOT
 be applied at any point to either the JSON string or to
 the string it is to be compared against.
3. Comparisons between the two strings MUST be performed as a
 Unicode code point to code point equality comparison.

---


### 6. Implementation Considerations

This specification defines features used by both Relying Parties and
 OpenID Providers that choose to implement Discovery.
 All of these Relying Parties and OpenID Providers
 MUST implement the features that are listed
 in this specification as being "REQUIRED" or are described with a "MUST".
 No other implementation considerations for implementations of
 Discovery are defined by this specification.

---


### 6.1. Compatibility Notes

NOTE: Potential compatibility issues that were previously described in
 the original version of this specification have since been addressed.

---


### 7. Security Considerations

---


### 7.1. TLS Requirements

Implementations MUST support TLS.
 Which version(s) ought to be implemented will vary over
 time, and depend on the widespread deployment and known
 security vulnerabilities at the time of implementation.
 At the time of this writing,
 TLS version 1.2 [RFC5246](#RFC5246) is the most recent version, but has very limited actual
 deployment, and might not be readily available in
 implementation toolkits.
 TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246](#RFC2246) is the most widely deployed version, and will give the
 broadest interoperability.

To protect against information disclosure and tampering,
 confidentiality protection MUST be applied using TLS
 with a ciphersuite that provides confidentiality and
 integrity protection.

Whenever TLS is used, a TLS server certificate check
 MUST be performed, per [RFC6125](#RFC6125).

---


### 7.2. Impersonation Attacks

TLS certificate checking MUST be performed by the RP,
 as described in [Section 7.1 (TLS Requirements)](#TLSRequirements),
 when making an OpenID Provider Configuration Request.
 Checking that the server certificate is valid for the Issuer URL
 prevents man-in-middle and DNS-based attacks.
 These attacks could cause an RP to be tricked into using an attacker's
 keys and endpoints, which would enable impersonation of the legitimate Issuer.
 If an attacker can accomplish this, they can access the accounts
 of any existing users at the affected RP that can be logged into
 using the OP that they are impersonating.

An attacker may also attempt to impersonate an OpenID Provider by publishing
 a Discovery document that contains an issuer Claim
 using the Issuer URL of the OP being impersonated,
 but with its own endpoints and signing keys.
 This would enable it to issue ID Tokens as that OP, if accepted by the RP.
 To prevent this, RPs MUST ensure that the Issuer URL they are using
 for the Configuration Request exactly matches the value of
 the issuer Claim
 in the OP Metadata document received by the RP
 and that this also exactly matches the iss Claim
 value in ID Tokens that are supposed to be from that Issuer.

---


### 8. IANA Considerations

---


### 8.1. Well-Known URI Registry

This specification registers the well-known URI defined in [Section 4 (Obtaining OpenID Provider Configuration Information)](#ProviderConfig) in the IANA
 "Well-Known URIs" registry [IANA.well-known](#IANA.well-known) established by [RFC5785](#RFC5785).

---

### 8.2. OAuth Authorization Server Metadata Registry

This specification registers the following metadata names in the
 IANA "OAuth Authorization Server Metadata" registry [IANA.OAuth.Parameters](#IANA.OAuth.Parameters) established by [RFC8414](#RFC8414).

---
